## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Ivan, also known as "IvanAndCode"
I'm an experienced test engineer currently focussing on helping people be better at test automation.

I’ve been in testing and test automation for around two decades. As part of my recent “test leadership” role where I had a “Principal Quality Assistant Engineer” title, I started spending more and more time teaching others. And I quickly realised that I liked it very much
But... 1-on-1 coaching doesn’t scale. There’s only one me and many of you. So here we are… doing the courses. Now you also get a chance to learn something from me.

If you are a junior test engineer or someone experienced who has never automated, I can help you. I specialise in the JavaScript ecosystem because it is a language of the web and learning it allows you to be a "full-stack" test engineer.

Some examples of what you can do with knowing ONLY JavaScript:
✅UI testing  
✅API testing  
✅Unit/integration testing  
✅Visual/component testing  
✅Performance testing  
...and more. You could also learn about the contract-first approach and building contracts, secret/credentials management, CI/CD pipelines, working with Git, and more, and more...

I am very excited to bring you on a learning journey.
Buckle up! Let's go!
